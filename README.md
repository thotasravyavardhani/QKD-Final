# BB84 QKD Professional Simulator & Testbed

## Overview

This is a professional-grade web application that simulates the BB84 Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol and serves as a virtual testbed for evaluating quantum device performance. The application provides both classical and quantum simulation capabilities, with real-time visualization of quantum channel communications, parameter testing, and security analysis. It's designed as a research tool for studying quantum cryptography protocols and testing quantum hardware integration.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
